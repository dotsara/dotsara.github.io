"What's the smallest step I can take to get unstuck?"

This is my newest motto, courtesy of [Jess](https://twitter.com/jessabean) (background: Jess &amp; I met when LivingSocial acquired InfoEther back in 2011). 

Jess and I have both been working on side projects ([hers](https://github.com/jessabean/100-javascript-projects), [mine](https://github.com/dotsara/100-projects)), looking for jobs, and interviewing. The smallest step concept came up during a recent Hangout and damn if it's not one of the most useful ideas I've heard in a long time.

Instead of worrying about the big picture when I'm stuck and already frustrated, I can focus and make progress.

So, thanks, Jess! :punch: :two_hearts:

[Sorry, Ms. Jackson: You’re Underrated. ‘Control’ at 30](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/arts/music/janet-jackson-control-anniversary.html?_r=0) by Wesley Morris

> Thirty years of “Control” is a useful, if contrived, excuse to argue for Ms. Jackson’s necessity, especially as someone who knew the power of an image. Take that hoop earring with the key. It was as iconic as L L Cool J’s Kangols, George Michael’s stubble and Steven Tyler’s scarves. It was the perfect symbol for both a project called “Control” and a woman whose guard has gone down and up over the decades. People thought that key was a potential invitation, something sexy. But what if it was just self-affirming? What if she was never looking for someone to give it to?
