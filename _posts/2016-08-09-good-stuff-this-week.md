First up, via [@jgarber](https://twitter.com/jgarber):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JavaScript 4K demo competition! Build an amazing app with fewer than 4096 dependencies</p>&mdash; Joe Groff (@jckarter) <a href="https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/762683017466744832">August 8, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

:joy:

And from [Matt Haughey](https://twitter.com/mathowie): [Practical tips on selling a car on Craigslist](https://15minutes.inthemorni.ng/practical-tips-on-selling-a-car-on-craigslist-585449da628c#.c54iguuht). A clean car and decent-to-good photos (enlist a friend!) might read to you as some flavor of fibbing, but **curb appeal** is a real thing (I don't think any of us are immune to it) and super duper worth the effort.

[To Seem Confident, Women Have to Be Seen as Warm](https://hbr.org/2016/07/to-seem-confident-women-have-to-be-seen-as-warm) (by [@margaritamayo](https://twitter.com/margaritmayo) &amp; via [stacy-marie ishmael's #awesomewomen](http://us4.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=1542aabcd614d3cd89d54600b&id=4a47f5fa43)). Nothing about this is a surprise, but I think it's worth sharing _because_ it's not surprising to/for women? If the concerns listed here aren't yours, even as an intellectual exercise think about having to keep them top of mind while at the same time learning, excelling, etc.

And finally:
