It is a little bit scary to say, out loud: I am burned out.

(For the purposes of _this_ discussion, burned out means deeply unmotivated and emotionally tapped-out with respect to my job.)

## How did this happen?

It happened when I wasn't looking. I wasn't looking because I forgot that looking out for myself at work is just like it is elsewhere: it takes constant vigilance (Professor Moody would be so disappointed).

This year:

* I have [done a ton of code clean-up]({% post_url 2015-08-06-a-developers-work-is-never-done %}): almost 10,000 LOC!
* I have worked on culture-related projects: improving documentation, _creating_ documentation, talking with new coworkers to learn what we (Engineering) look like to their fresh eyes
* I am working on one of the longest-running, most demanding projects I've ever been on
* I am turning into a bit of a pair programming fanatic (you would, too, if you had weekly sessions with [@tcopeland](https://twitter.com/tcopeland), [@supwhaley](https://twitter.com/supwhaley), and [@keekerdc](https://twitter.com/keekerdc)!)

These are all good things! But at some point, I decided that work was going well and hey! That's good enough, right!? Right? Right.

## _What_ happened?

At the top of the list: I've taken almost no time off this year. A day or two, here and there, but nothing significant and cumulatively less than a full week.

I _know_. I mean, I know it _now_. 

I didn't plan ahead, I didn't take stock at regular intervals, I just… kept swimming. 

Next up! In early spring this year, I hurt my back pretty seriously. And then I spent four months at… 25% my physical capacity? It fucking _sucked_. 

<a id="keavy-suggestion"></a>
I couldn't run, I couldn't lift, I couldn't swim (at first), I couldn't sit for long periods of time, for two months I couldn't even get out of bed without pain. :disappointed: It was weeks before I could stand walk more than a few blocks. And even longer before I called additional blocks _victories_. 

Probably I could have taken time off to chill, but I didn't. I felt like I needed work to help keep me from spiraling downward emotionally.

And finally, while I was relying on work, which has been mostly good! this year, there's also been some _not_ good.

* organizational change in general: big team shifts and lay-offs (emotionally taxing: :ballot_box_with_check: ; mentally draining: :ballot_box_with_check: )
* me, in particular: I've had 3 managers this year, each with their own style of managing (mentally draining: :ballot_box_with_check: )
* that long-running project? It's all new code, new-and-yet-familiar security concerns, a tiny team, and tight turnarounds (emotionally taxing: :ballot_box_with_check: ; mentally draining: :ballot_box_with_check: )

## Why did it take me so long to figure it out?

Newton's First Law of Motion?

This year, I've accidentally taught myself that regular check-ins aren't a thing: I didn't start out doing it and life rolled along and then I hurt my back and that took 150% of my attention and then I wasn't hurt and I was so excited to _not_ be hurt and that took 200% of my attention.

Etcetera.

What finally made me consider that I am burned out is the morning I said my goal for the day was to _not_ cry before lunch. 

![Cap can't even.](http://31.media.tumblr.com/be7a64491313624a3daf33c8a1674a46/tumblr_nbeaafVg9J1r1thdeo1_250.gif)

You said it, Cap.

## Now what?

Now, I've said it to my bosses and coworkers and friends and asked for help. I was prepared for disbelief, or incredulity, or disappointment (d. all of the above) that I'd let this happen but instead I received support and commiseration. :heart_eyes: 

Now, I'm taking time off. Three full weeks before the end of the year(!). It's a start. 

Now, I have calendar events scheduled to remind me to press pause and look around, make notes and goals (even little ones), then to follow-up on those.

Now, I don't work through lunch every single day, I turn email & calendars off (and log out of Slack) on Friday nights. If I can reestablish that work doesn't always get to come first, then maybe I won't let it.

So that's where I'm at: not the best place, but not the worst, armed with a few plans, some determination, and lots of help. Here goes!
