2+ months away means forgetting the steps to running this locally and then deploying. Heh. 
* `jekyll serve --watch` to work locally
* push to origin to update!

Things I'd like to add once the site has a decent # of posts:
* category & tag pages (also start _showing_ those on posts)
* bloggy navigation (back to the main page, amongst posts themselves)

Categories I definitely plan to writeâ€¦in? about?
* TIL
* photography
* running
* Ruby
