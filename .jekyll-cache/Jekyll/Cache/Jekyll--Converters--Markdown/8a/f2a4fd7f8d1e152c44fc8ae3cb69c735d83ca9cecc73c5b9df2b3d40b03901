I"¼<p>â€œWhatâ€™s the smallest step I can take to get unstuck?â€</p>

<p>This is my newest motto, courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/jessabean">Jess</a> (background: Jess &amp; I met when LivingSocial acquired InfoEther back in 2011).</p>

<p>Jess and I have both been working on side projects (<a href="https://github.com/jessabean/100-javascript-projects">hers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dotsara/100-projects">mine</a>), looking for jobs, and interviewing. The smallest step concept came up during a recent Hangout and damn if itâ€™s not one of the most useful ideas Iâ€™ve heard in a long time.</p>

<p>Instead of worrying about the big picture when Iâ€™m stuck and already frustrated, I can focus and make progress.</p>

<p>So, thanks, Jess! :punch: :two_hearts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thirty years of â€œControlâ€ is a useful, if contrived, excuse to argue for Ms. Jacksonâ€™s necessity, especially as someone who knew the power of an image. Take that hoop earring with the key. It was as iconic as L L Cool Jâ€™s Kangols, George Michaelâ€™s stubble and Steven Tylerâ€™s scarves. It was the perfect symbol for both a project called â€œControlâ€ and a woman whose guard has gone down and up over the decades. People thought that key was a potential invitation, something sexy. But what if it was just self-affirming? What if she was never looking for someone to give it to?</p>
