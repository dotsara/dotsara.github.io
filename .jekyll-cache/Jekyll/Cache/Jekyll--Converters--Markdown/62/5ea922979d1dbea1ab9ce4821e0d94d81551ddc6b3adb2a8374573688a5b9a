I"€<p>Last month, <a href="https://twitter.com/dotsara/status/710157222391615489">I was laid off</a> (<a href="http://recode.net/2016/03/16/livingsocial-is-laying-off-more-than-50-percent-of-its-staff/">more info</a>). 2 days after my 5-year anniversary, no less! :persevere:</p>

<p>But what Iâ€™m interested in today is what happened <em>before</em> I was laid off. Orâ€¦Â <em>while</em> I was being laid off? Ugh, whichever.</p>

<p>My last team made heavy, heavy use of <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>â€™s <a href="https://slack.com/apps">integrations</a>; in fact, we had a channel (<code class="highlighter-rouge">#flex-team-bots</code>!) just for Github and CI-related (continuous integration) messages. New pull request? <em>Message!</em> Build failed on <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> server? <em>Message!</em></p>

<p>All of that would have been 150% overwhelming in our regular channel, but siloed this way they were easy to consume as needed.</p>

<p>The morning of the layoffs, right as DM conversations about layoffs fired up, I noticed a bunch of integrations in multiple channels disappearing. <em>So-and-so deleted an integration in this channel: Github</em></p>

<p>After a handful of these, I @-messaged the person whose name paired with the delete messages, asking if he was auditing integrations or what.</p>

<p>Right about then, <a href="https://twitter.com/m_evans10">Mike Evans</a> DMâ€™d me to point out that when a Slack account is deletedâ€¦Â any integrations that account setup are deleted as well.</p>

<p>Oh. <em>Ooooh.</em> Oh, fuck.</p>

<p>So, <strong>tl;dr</strong>: the Slack account responsible for deleting is the account used in automated messages to the channels/people specified by a given integration.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-thoughts">A few thoughtsâ€¦</h2>

<ol>
  <li>I donâ€™t imagine anyone expected automated messages to act as a coal mine canary, my goal here isnâ€™t to wag a finger at Slack, I just wanted to point this out.   <br /><br />
<em>Knowing is half the battleâ€¦?</em></li>
  <li>In this situation, the person responsible for deleting might not <em>enjoy</em> having to do it but the way Slack seems to be set up, that person ends up <em>the face</em> of it (who knows how many DMs and @â€™s he got that dayâ€¦Â  :confused: ).   <br /><br />
 <em>Maybe <strong>slackbot</strong> could â€œsendâ€ these messages?</em></li>
  <li>Because the automated messages donâ€™t provide any detail beyond their app (Github, New Relic, etc.) thereâ€™s no way to know <em>which</em> integration was deleted. It might have been really important and useful, but once the dust settles and people realize itâ€™s missing, itâ€™s a guessing game about how to get it back.   <br /><br />
<em>An integration archive might be useful here?</em> <br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">[integration app] [channel destination] [settings] [dates]</code></li>
</ol>
