I"∂<p>Aloha!</p>

<p>So, check it out: it took me <em>almost</em> 10 attempts to grok how to make a Jekyll-Github pages site again. I‚Äôd done it once before, but went 18 months never updating it, so, y‚Äôknow: clean slate! (<em>I know, I know:</em> dead links.) Fool that I can sometimes be, I totally thought this time it would be easier. Jekyll gem, all this extra experience under my belt, blah blah blah‚Ä¶¬†</p>

<p>I can hear you laughing from here.</p>

<p>I tried 4 times to start over again using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll‚Äôs own documentation</a> and for reasons I don‚Äôt fully understand myself, I‚Äôd hit a brick wall after running <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll new name-of-my-new-site</code>.</p>

<p>Instead of boring you with how spectacularly stumped I can get, I‚Äôll tell you what finally worked for me.</p>

<p>Before doing anything at <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> or at the command line, I opened up a bunch of Github Pages tutorials and read through them. (I can, fairly, be accused of sometimes jumping too soon and trying to start a thing before reading all the instructions. <em>ahem</em>)</p>

<p>I had tried (and failed) so many times to start from scratch, so the first step in <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">this Smashing Magazine tutorial</a> where you fork a ready-made Jekyll repo and just edit the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> is what really helped everything fall into place for me.</p>

<p><a href="http://jxnblk.com/Heather">Heather</a> is the theme I wanted to use and now that I got the whole fork-then-edit thing, starting over with Heather was a snap. Hooray!</p>

<p>If you have a <a href="https://github.com/dotsara/dotsara.github.io">peek at the repo for this site</a>, you‚Äôll notice that it doesn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs forked from the Heather repo, anymore. And that‚Äôs because in the spirit of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, try it out!‚Äù I wanted to learn how to kill the commit history on a forked repo. (There‚Äôs no real need for me to keep it in this instance.)</p>

<p>Stack Overflow to the rescue! <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4515580/how-do-i-remove-the-old-history-from-a-git-repository">How do I remove the old history from a git repository?</a> Way down at the bottom, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/28081807">I found what I was after</a>.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what I did locally:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fork the Heather theme to my repo</li>
  <li>Rename the newly-forked repo to <code class="highlighter-rouge">dotsara.github.io</code> (Settings &gt; Repository name)</li>
  <li>Clone the repo (via SSH because I don‚Äôt want to have to enter my user/pass every. single. time) to my machine: <code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone git@github.com:dotsara/dotsara.github.io.git</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> into my new folder: <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd dotsara.github.io</code></li>
  <li>Delete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.git</code> directory, re-initialize the folder as a git folder, add a remote server back <br />
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo rm -r .git &amp;&amp; git init &amp;&amp; git remote add origin git@github.com:dotsara/dotsara.github.io.git</code></li>
  <li>Edit this blog post, make a new commit (which will show all the Jekyll &amp; theme files as new/untracked) and push!</li>
</ul>

<p>:tada:</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs‚Ä¶¬†that. See you soon!</p>
