  <p class="small gray"><time datetime="2015-11-12">12 November 2015</time></p>
  <p>It is a little bit scary to say, out loud: I am burned out.</p>

<p>(For the purposes of <em>this</em> discussion, burned out means deeply unmotivated and emotionally tapped-out with respect to my job.)</p>

<h2 id="how-did-this-happen">How did this happen?</h2>

<p>It happened when I wasn’t looking. I wasn’t looking because I forgot that looking out for myself at work is just like it is elsewhere: it takes constant vigilance (Professor Moody would be so disappointed).</p>

<p>This year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have <a href="/2015/a-developers-work-is-never-done">done a ton of code clean-up</a>: almost 10,000 LOC!</li>
  <li>I have worked on culture-related projects: improving documentation, <em>creating</em> documentation, talking with new coworkers to learn what we (Engineering) look like to their fresh eyes</li>
  <li>I am working on one of the longest-running, most demanding projects I’ve ever been on</li>
  <li>I am turning into a bit of a pair programming fanatic (you would, too, if you had weekly sessions with <a href="https://twitter.com/tcopeland">@tcopeland</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/supwhaley">@supwhaley</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/keekerdc">@keekerdc</a>!)</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all good things! But at some point, I decided that work was going well and hey! That’s good enough, right!? Right? Right.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">
<em>What</em> happened?</h2>

<p>At the top of the list: I’ve taken almost no time off this year. A day or two, here and there, but nothing significant and cumulatively less than a full week.</p>

<p><img src="http://49.media.tumblr.com/2bab0e1b469c340457ed0b4e07dff0aa/tumblr_nry5xpN0Rc1r1thdeo1_400.gif" alt="Latrice is not pleased."></p>

<p>I <em>know</em>. I mean, I know it <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>I didn’t plan ahead, I didn’t take stock at regular intervals, I just… kept swimming.</p>

<p>Next up! In early spring this year, I hurt my back pretty seriously. And then I spent four months at… 25% my physical capacity? It fucking <em>sucked</em>.</p>

<p><a id="keavy-suggestion"></a>
I couldn’t run, I couldn’t lift, I couldn’t swim (at first), I couldn’t sit for long periods of time, for two months I couldn’t even get out of bed without pain. <img class="emoji" title=":disappointed:" alt=":disappointed:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f61e.png" height="20" width="20"> It was weeks before I could stand walk more than a few blocks. And even longer before I called additional blocks <em>victories</em>.</p>

<p>Probably I could have taken time off to chill, but I didn’t. I felt like I needed work to help keep me from spiraling downward emotionally.</p>

<p>And finally, while I was relying on work, which has been mostly good! this year, there’s also been some <em>not</em> good.</p>

<ul>
  <li>organizational change in general: big team shifts and lay-offs (emotionally taxing: <img class="emoji" title=":ballot_box_with_check:" alt=":ballot_box_with_check:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2611.png" height="20" width="20"> ; mentally draining: <img class="emoji" title=":ballot_box_with_check:" alt=":ballot_box_with_check:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2611.png" height="20" width="20"> )</li>
  <li>me, in particular: I’ve had 3 managers this year, each with their own style of managing (mentally draining: <img class="emoji" title=":ballot_box_with_check:" alt=":ballot_box_with_check:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2611.png" height="20" width="20"> )</li>
  <li>that long-running project? It’s all new code, new-and-yet-familiar security concerns, a tiny team, and tight turnarounds (emotionally taxing: <img class="emoji" title=":ballot_box_with_check:" alt=":ballot_box_with_check:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2611.png" height="20" width="20"> ; mentally draining: <img class="emoji" title=":ballot_box_with_check:" alt=":ballot_box_with_check:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2611.png" height="20" width="20"> )</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-did-it-take-me-so-long-to-figure-it-out">Why did it take me so long to figure it out?</h2>

<p>Newton’s First Law of Motion?</p>

<p>This year, I’ve accidentally taught myself that regular check-ins aren’t a thing: I didn’t start out doing it and life rolled along and then I hurt my back and that took 150% of my attention and then I wasn’t hurt and I was so excited to <em>not</em> be hurt and that took 200% of my attention.</p>

<p>Etcetera.</p>

<p>What finally made me consider that I am burned out is the morning I said my goal for the day was to <em>not</em> cry before lunch.</p>

<p><img src="http://31.media.tumblr.com/be7a64491313624a3daf33c8a1674a46/tumblr_nbeaafVg9J1r1thdeo1_250.gif" alt="Cap can't even."></p>

<p>You said it, Cap.</p>

<h2 id="now-what">Now what?</h2>

<p>Now, I’ve said it to my bosses and coworkers and friends and asked for help. I was prepared for disbelief, or incredulity, or disappointment (d. all of the above) that I’d let this happen but instead I received support and commiseration. <img class="emoji" title=":heart_eyes:" alt=":heart_eyes:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60d.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>Now, I’m taking time off. Three full weeks before the end of the year(!). It’s a start.</p>

<p>Now, I have calendar events scheduled to remind me to press pause and look around, make notes and goals (even little ones), then to follow-up on those.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t work through lunch every single day, I turn email &amp; calendars off (and log out of Slack) on Friday nights. If I can reestablish that work doesn’t always get to come first, then maybe I won’t let it.</p>

<p>So that’s where I’m at: not the best place, but not the worst, armed with a few plans, some determination, and lots of help. Here goes!</p>
