  <h1><a href="/2017/new-tunes" title="More new music, please!">More new music, please!</a></h1>
  <p class="small gray"><time datetime="2017-01-16">16 January 2017</time></p>
  <p>I have this habit of listening to singles, albums, and playlists over and over (and over) again. Last year, unemployed and looking for work, I indulged the tendency without a second thought. Only a very few songs–and the “Hamilton” cast album–managed to break into my sonic security blanket fort.</p>

<p>In my music library, I keep a playlist for each year filled with newly-discovered singles. While 2010 has the largest count at 105, 2016 is the smallest at an anemic 16. <img class="emoji" title=":confused:" alt=":confused:" src="https://assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f615.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" /> (And! Beyoncé, Rihanna, and JoJo account for 10 spots.)</p>

<p>So for 2017: no more sonic security blankets. I’ll definitely listen to favorites (you’ll take my Ella Fitzgerald/Louis Armstrong-seeded Pandora station from my cold dead hands), but it’s time to start exploring again.</p>

<p>But how to accomplish “listen to more new music” without turning it into a chore that I’ll definitely abandon?</p>

<p>I found the answer a couple of days into January when I opened Spotify and counted all the playlists in the sidebar. 45. Oy. So, I did the only rational thing: I deleted most of the playlists I created and unfollowed every playlist I hadn’t.</p>

<p>Now, when I fire up Spotify I head first to their curated playlists or the “mood” collections and go from there. A couple of weeks in, 2017 is on track to outstrip 2016 by an order of magnitude in additions to  my “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/dotsara/playlist/5lA85C8bu4zRpVCqu88jMa">All the new (to me) that’s fit to listen</a>” playlist. <img class="emoji" title=":nail_care:" alt=":nail_care:" src="https://assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f485.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" /> <img class="emoji" title=":notes:" alt=":notes:" src="https://assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f3b6.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" /></p>
